# InnoQuest Emerging Tech Bootcamp Cohort-1

Welcome to my GitHub repository for the **InnoQuest Emerging Tech Bootcamp Cohort-1**! Iâ€™m excited to be participating in this immersive bootcamp, which is designed to help learners like myself build skills and gain hands-on experience in **Data Science**, **Machine Learning (ML)**, **Deep Learning (DL)**, **Computer Vision (CV)**, **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, and **MLOps**.

Throughout this journey, Iâ€™ll be completing assignments, projects, and hands-on exercises that will help me apply the concepts I learn to real-world problems. The bootcamp provides an opportunity to dive deep into these fields, work with industry-standard tools like Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and more, and develop practical applications of AI.
